The history of Pacific Wild begins in the late 1980's when Karen and Ian McAllister started their journey to protect the wilderness and wildlife within beautiful British Columbia by campaigning to protect Vancouver Island's rainforest from endangerment. From there the McAllister's moved north in 1990 to begin a new conservation mission by establishing a year round base in the Great Bear Rainforest in order to protect the north and central coast of BC. During their explorations of the wilderness in northern BC, the McAllister's ultimately decided to release a book titled "The Great Bear Rainforest: Canada's Forgotten Coast" in 1997 which details the immense beauty to be found in the enchanting and lush forests. The book also entails how the destruction has taken so much of the land that is meant to be the home of the Grizzly Bear, which faces the constant threat of endangerment due to human development and hunting. This book brought the McAllister's worldwide recognition and support for protecting the Great Bear Rainforest which contributed to the Great Bear Rainforest agreements in 2006 that assigned 30% of the land as protected designations. Altogether these efforts lead to the founding of Pacific Wild in 2008 so that they could be an unwavering loud voice in the fight to conserve the diverse nature and wildlife of the Great Bear Rainforest.
