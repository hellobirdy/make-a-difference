After all my thorough reading and research into Pacific Wild's conservation efforts, I can without a doubt say that this organization is worthy of a high level of respect and support as the leading team to protect the natural beauty and wildlife in British Columbia. They've had numerous successes with their campaigns gaining recognition around the world which has led to multiple changes in legislation and conservation efforts within British Columbia and specifically the Great Bear Rainforest. Their efforts have resulted in an oil tanker ban in the Great Bear Sea where tankers carrying over 12,500 metric tonnes of crude oil are no longer allowed, but there is still work to be done in that effort due to the fact any tankers carrying less than that or LNG are still allowed through the region. Pacific Wild has also managed to push forward with the grizzly trophy hunt ban in the Great Bear Rainforest that will be implemented after the fall 2017 hunt, however, this change doesn't apply to the bears in the rest of the province. Their efforts are still desperately needed for the protection of wild salmon, pacific herring, marine mammals in the Great Bear Sea, and the habitats they all preside in. In the years to come I hope to see Pacific Wild continuously on the frontline working to protect a multitude of natural regions and wildlife species in danger from human activities in British Columbia.
