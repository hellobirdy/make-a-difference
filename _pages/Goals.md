Pacific Wild's campaigns and long terms goals have so far brought worldwide recognition to their conservation efforts within the Great Bear Rainforest in British Columbia. These efforts have been fundamental in the survival and success of the wildlife and environmental habitats within the Great Bear region and beyond. However, there is still more battles that must be won in order to protect the rare and beautiful rainforest that hundreds of species call home.

## LNG 

The current goal at Pacific Wild in regards to oil tankers and LNG tankers is to hopefully obtain a full ban on them within the Great Bear Sea to preserve the marine environment and marine species that are trying to thrive and recover in the area. 

## Pacific Herring

As an integral part of the coastal communities and local wildlife, herring stocks need more protection from unsustainable kill fisheries so that the local stocks can rebuild and provide sustenance for the ecosystem. 

## Wild Salmon

With much work still required to achieve a better conservation level with wild salmon, Pacific Wild is determined to keep providing resistance against unsustainable fish farms and human destruction of natural habitats in spawning areas that damage wild salmon stocks. 

## B.C. Wolves

The B.C. Wolves Management Plan is now an outdated plan that is in dire need of an overhaul in light of the recent wolf cull showcasing inhumane persecution of wolves as a scapegoat for our actions in destroying wild caribou habitats. Pacific Wild hopes the government will see reason and begin a new management plan for the wolf populations with more reliable studies and estimates.

## Grizzly Bears

Although the government has made the first small step against grizzly bear trophy hunting there is still a long road ahead to reach an appropriate conservation level for the species. The unsustainable trophy hunting across B.C. is depleting the population by hundreds more every year and due to the flawed estimation of their population it is likely they're being overkilled at this rate. In the years to come Pacific Wild hopes to put a stop to this unnecessary hunt to protect a vital animal in the British Columbian ecosystems. 

## Forest Conservation

With only one third of the Great Bear Rainforest under protection, Pacific Wild still has a heavy fight ahead of them to ensure that the estimated 70% of the old growth forests required to remain intact stays untouched so that the region may survive. However, clear cut logging and other industrial developments have access to the 70% of the unprotected areas. Pacific Wild will remain as the loud voice and resistance against this human destruction of such a beautiful rainforest that demands protection from our own greed and carelessness.
