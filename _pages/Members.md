## Karen McAllister - Conservation Director

As the co-founder and conservation director of Pacific Wild, Karen McAllister has set the stage for inspiration in the conservation world. She originally began her involvement in protecting wildlife over two decades ago on Vancouver Island and then moved to the north coast of BC with her husband, Ian McAllister, to protect the Great Bear Rainforest. In this time she coauthored the book "The Great Bear Rainforest" with her husband which gained international recognition and concern for their cause to protect the rainforest from excessive logging and trophy hunting. Karen currently resides on Denny Island with her husband and two children.  


## Krista Roessingh - GBEAR Partner & Programs Coordinator

With an MSc. in Ecology and Geography, Krista began her journey with Pacific Wild to protect the rainforest and the north coast as she settled into life on Denny Island with her family.

Colette's professional background is in archaeology and teaching youth and adults with a BA(Hons) History/Archaeology from Anglia University, Cambridge. After several years in Asia and Europe teaching multiple variations of English language learning, she moved back to the west coast and up to Denny Island in the Great Bear Rainforest.
Colette joined Pacific Wild in early 2011 with social media/outreach campaign work at the time of the Great Bear RAVE and the No Pipeline, No Tankers movement. As Pacific Wild has evolved, Colette's role has grown to include event organization. 
Utilizing the literature, visual media, curriculum materials and awesome remote Great Bear LIVE camera feeds, Colette's dream is to bring the Great Bear to people all over the world. Colette's strong belief is that through education, outreach and awareness, our coast can and will be conserved and protected.
