## Karen McAllister - Conservation Director

As the co-founder and conservation director of Pacific Wild, Karen McAllister has set the stage for inspiration in the conservation world. She originally began her involvement in protecting wildlife over two decades ago on Vancouver Island and then moved to the north coast of BC with her husband, Ian McAllister, to protect the Great Bear Rainforest. In this time she coauthored the book "The Great Bear Rainforest" with her husband which gained international recognition and concern for their cause to protect the rainforest from excessive logging and trophy hunting. Karen currently resides on Denny Island with her husband and two children.
