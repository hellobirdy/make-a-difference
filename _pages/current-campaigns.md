## Ocean Campaigns

## Great Bear Sea Hydrophone Network

This campaign has been set up in order to better understand the acoustic landscape of the Great Bear Sea on the north coast of British Columbia. Although there is currently little acoustic pollution to be found, it cannot be ignored that there has been fourteen new energy projects either proposed or in put into progress for the area which could be devastating for the marine life. Creatures such as humpback whales, killer whales, dolphins, herring, and rockfish would all be affected by this noise pollution which could ultimately destroy the beautiful habitat they preside in if driven away due to human activity. In order to prevent such a tragedy from befalling the Great Bear Sea, Pacific Wild has partnered with the Heiltsuk First Nation and has implemented six remote hydrophone stations to monitor and study the acoustics. The audio from these hydrophones is also available online for anyone to listen to across the world so that everyone can get a better understanding of life in the Great Bear Sea.

## No Tankers

The 'No Tankers' movement has garnered thousands of supporters all throughout B.C., and it finally became loud enough that in May of 2017 the Government of Canada put through legislation to ban oil tankers carrying over 12,500 metric tonnes of crude oil in the Great Bear Sea. However, this legislation comes with a massive loophole which is that tankers carrying less than the 12,500 metric tonnes or other refined petroleum products such as Liquified Natural Gas can still make shipments through the area. The consequences of this loophole are already well known from the sinking of the Nathan E. Stewart tank-barge that sank off the coast of Bella Bella in October of 2016 which affected the local Heiltsuk Nation and the wildlife habitats from the spillage. This brings to light the three big important reasons why tankers should not be allowed to pass through the Great Bear Sea: deadly ship strikes, drowning in sound pollution, and spill devastation.

## Herring

Although just a foraging fish, pacific herring is considered to be one of the most important species on the Pacific coast due to the interactions with a multitide of predators and prey. The herring spawn within inlets or bays when they come in from the open ocean during late winter and a single female can lay up to 20,000 eggs. As a result of this spawning cycle, many different predators such as wolves, bears, birds, sea lions, and humpback whales are given sustenance to survive. Altogether, this natural cycle allows the rich biodiversity of the Great Bear Rainforest and sea to thrive just from this one important foraging fish. Unfortunately, after the usage of industrial-scale reduction fisheries in the early 20th century most of the herring stocks collapsed in the 1960's and the stocks have remained strained ever since. 

Despite the struggles that the pacific herring stocks have encountered there is still hope for the species. First Nations communities are known to have a history of harvesting herring for trade and consumption with a method of only collecting eggs amongst the shore within kelp or hemlock branches. This sustainable method allows the herring to continue to spawn or provide sustenance for local predators within the ecosystem. With Pacific Wild working to protect this species along with the First Nations communities the pacific herring may just thrive once more in the years to come.

## Marine Planning

With the constant threats from industrial shipping, salmon farms, fishing pressure, and climate change looming over the diverse marine life in the Great Bear Rainforest and sea there comes a dire need for planning and protection of the ecosystem. This is where Pacific Wild has stepped in with the First Nations communities and provincial government to work together to help implement the Marine Planning Partnership (MaPP) in order to protect the B.C. coast. Furthermore, there's also talks between the First Nations, the provincial government, and the federal government to design a network of protected marine areas called the Northern Bioregion Marine Protected Areas Network. These engagements with both levels of government are done in hopes to achieve conservation targets for a massive range of habitats and species within. 

The importance of these plans brings to light that human activity is slowly destroying the biodiversity within ecosystems such as the Great Bear Rainforest and sea. However, with plans and designated protection areas in place the ecosystems would then be allowed to recover over time. The biggest fault that unfortunately comes with these plans though is that they offer little to no protection from threats outside of the designated boundaries. Some of these threats include ocean acidification, tanker noise, fishing pressure, amd contamination from toxins. Although there are some other successful tools and ideas that exist to help combat these threats, there is always more room to expand for convservation targets with marine planning and MPAs. 

## Wild Salmon

As one of the most important foundations of the Great Bear ecosystem, wild salmon unfortunately face a multitude of threats from human activity. With our constant logging, road building, and other land changes in the Great Bear there has been drastic effects on the spawning habitats and salmon stocks. This serves as an important reminder that without the yearly salmon runs having enough to sustain a variety of marine mammals and wildlife on land, the biodiversity of the ecosystems will falter without the chance to recover if we don't take action against the harmful practices with fish farms and industrial development.

## Land Campaigns

## Stop the Trophy Hunt

The more you learn about bear populations in B.C., the more appalling the idea of trophy hunting becomes. Bears are vulnerable to population decline. Once numbering an estimated 35,000 in B.C., grizzly populations have been reduced to anywhere from 6,000 to 15,000. Government science used to estimate populations, and therefore set hunting quotas, is in dispute, and nobody knows exactly how many grizzlies remain. Yet every year trophy hunters shoot between 300 and 400 grizzlies. The combined pressure of hunting, habitat fragmentation, urbanization and other human-caused disturbance has already removed them from considerable portions of their traditional habitat in British Columbia. Economics are on the side of grizzlies. It's been clearly demonstrated that a live grizzly is worth more to the economy, in terms of tourism generation, than one killed for sport.

For these reasons, in September 2012, First Nations in the Great Bear Rainforest announced a ban on bear trophy hunting. An overwhelming body of evidence supports their view that this hunt is unethical, unwanted and unwise. Public pressure is mounting. Now’s the time to let the Canadian authorities know that the killing must end before B.C.’s bears are pushed to the brink of extinction.
