## Ocean Campaigns

## Great Bear Sea Hydrophone Network

This campaign has been set up in order to better understand the acoustic landscape of the Great Bear Sea on the north coast of British Columbia. Although there is currently little acoustic pollution to be found, it cannot be ignored that there has been fourteen new energy projects either proposed or in put into progress for the area which could be devastating for the marine life. Creatures such as humpback whales, killer whales, dolphins, herring, and rockfish would all be affected by this noise pollution which could ultimately destroy the beautiful habitat they preside in if driven away due to human activity. In order to prevent such a tragedy from befalling the Great Bear Sea, Pacific Wild has partnered with the Heiltsuk First Nation and has implemented six remote hydrophone stations to monitor and study the acoustics. The audio from these hydrophones is also available online for anyone to listen to across the world so that everyone can get a better understanding of life in the Great Bear Sea.
