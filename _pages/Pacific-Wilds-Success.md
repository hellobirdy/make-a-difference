After all my thorough reading and research into Pacific Wild's conservation efforts, I can without a doubt say that this organization is worthy of a high level of respect and support as the leading team to protect the natural beauty and wildlife in British Columbia. They've had numerous successes with their campaigns gaining recognition around the world which has led to multiple changes in legislation and conservation efforts within British Columbia and specifically the Great Bear Rainforest. In the years to come I hope to see Pacific Wild still on the frontline working to protect a multitude of natural regions and wildlife species in danger from human activities.
